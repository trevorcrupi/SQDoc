# SQDoc

This is a documentation generator that reads a file tree for markdown files and starts up a static site using those files. It is based on your file tree, so if you have a markdown file to document a component in src/components/MyCoolComponent.md, you can run `sqdoc serve`, then go to http://localhost:3001/src/components/MyCoolComponent and the documentation will be displayed in a nice format for you. 

This is being actively developed, so use at your own risk until full test coverage is achieved (not to say it doesn't work, I wouldn't publish it if it didn't work).
